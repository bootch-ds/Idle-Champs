******************************************************
*	LEVEL DETECTOR GEM FARM
******************************************************
This script is designed to farm gems and automatically progress through low level areas, then resetting and starting over the same mission
It achieves this by leveling click damage and champs but mostly allows for familiars to instant kill the mobs (note works best with at least 3 familiars for the autoloot)
It utilizes a pixel-color detector to determine when the game is changing levels and various events

/*NOTE: times are out of date*/
Overall my average run time from point to point is 8 min with 6 familiars and Torm Fav > 1e10 (fastest ive noted is 7:40) 
there are points where this can be speed up

*	Recent Changes:
******************************************************
	Version - 191010 (10/10/19)
		modification: moved User Settings to the MW_Settings_1280x720.ahk
			now all user edits should be in the MW_Settings_1280x720.ahk file vs MadWizard.ahk
		bug fix: corrected error where Formation to use (Q/W/E) was ignoring the Keyboard Override functionality
		bug fix: corrected error where script was finding wrong town (due to Update/Player progression)
		bug fix: corrected issue where 1st familiar was not always being placed
		added option: to minimize flashing when placing familiars (due to Update on how familiar placement)
		added setting: to set which champs are targeted for Early Priority Leveling (ie deeking/shandi/minsc)
			moved this to Settings vs modifying the MadWizard.ahk
		correction: Vajra should be spelled correctly		
		(thx Neal for several of these issues)
		
******************************************************		
*	WARNINGS/Potential Issues/Recommendations
******************************************************
	Potential Issue: 	Having Title Bar turned off will create a shift in the Y values and Scrit wont be able find several Locations (Jadisero)
	Potential Issue:	If bottom IC Window is off screen script may not work properly (thx Cyber Nemesis)
	Required:			Ensure Level Up Button (bottom left corner) is set to UPG vs x1/10/100 (thx Cyber Nemesis)
	
	Warning:			Pausing Script while on Boss Level will throw off the Level Counter 
						(while script should still work may run an extra level and Leveling Champs/ClickDmg will be out of sync for that run)
	Wanring:			Typing Chest Codes with Script running may trigger the Formation Override instead of using the Setting assignment
	Recommended:		Pause Script prior to opening in game windows (store/high rollers/etc)
	Disclaimer: 		Pixel Colors and Positions may need to be tweaked to run correctly for your system (but this should be a 1 time process)
	
******************************************************	
*	Script Customizing: (MW_Settings_1280x720.ahk)
******************************************************	
		global nMax_Level 				:= 30	;sets the level that the script will run to for each iteration

			Sets whether the "F" Key will be pressed down and up for each Familiar
			1 will do a seperate Key Press for each familiar being placed => multiple screen flashes when placing familiars
			0 will hold the "F" key down till all familiars are placed => 2 screen flashes (1 at start and 1 at end of placement)
			NOTE: if using 0 then may cause secondary issues if game or script crashes without releasing the "F" key
	
	
	******************************************************
